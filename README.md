🤖 UiPath Collaboration & Branching Workflow (GitHub)

A demonstration project showing how to effectively collaborate on UiPath automation projects using GitHub branching strategies.
The goal is to enable multiple developers to work on the same UiPath project without conflicts, ensuring smooth version control, testing, and deployment.

🎯 Overview

UiPath projects are often developed by teams where:

Multiple automation developers work on different workflows.

Features and bug fixes must be tracked and merged.

Stable versions must be maintained for production.

This project explores how to structure, branch, and collaborate on UiPath projects using GitHub.

✨ Key Practices

🌱 Branching Strategy

main → production-ready workflows

develop → integration/testing branch

feature/* → new automation features

bugfix/* → fixes for issues

hotfix/* → urgent production fixes

👩‍💻 Collaboration Workflow

Create a feature branch for new workflow development.

Commit changes to GitHub frequently with meaningful messages.

Open a Pull Request (PR) for code review.

Merge into develop after approval.

Deploy stable changes from main.

🧪 Testing & Validation

Use UiPath Studio for local testing.

Run validations before merging.

Maintain consistent dependency versions across branches.

📂 Project Structure

/Main.xaml → entry workflow

/Workflows/ → modular process workflows

/Tests/ → testing automation scripts

/Config/ → assets & settings

🛠️ Tools & Tech

UiPath Studio – for automation development

UiPath Orchestrator – for deployment (optional)

GitHub – version control & collaboration

Branching Strategy – GitFlow-based workflow

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/uipath-collaboration.git
cd uipath-collaboration


Open the project in UiPath Studio.

Create a feature branch before starting new work:

git checkout -b feature/my-new-workflow


Commit and push your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Added new invoice processing workflow"
git push origin feature/my-new-workflow


Open a Pull Request in GitHub for review.

🤝 Collaboration Notes

Always sync with develop before creating a feature branch.

Keep workflow modular to reduce merge conflicts.

Use Pull Requests to ensure peer review.

Document workflow changes in commit messages.
